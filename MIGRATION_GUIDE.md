## üîß Part 3: Code Changes (Making App Use Google Sheets)

### **Current State (Using Mock Data)**

Example from `app/(tabs)/home.tsx`:

```typescript
import { MOCK_PRODUCTS } from '@/mocks/products';

export default function HomeScreen() {
  const products = MOCK_PRODUCTS; // ‚Üê Local mock data

  const alignedBrands = products.filter(p => p.alignmentScore > 0);
  const unalignedBrands = products.filter(p => p.alignmentScore < 0);

  return <BrandList brands={alignedBrands} />;
}
```

### **New State (Using Google Sheets)**

```typescript
import { trpc } from '@/lib/trpc'; // ‚Üê Import tRPC client
import { ActivityIndicator } from 'react-native';

export default function HomeScreen() {
  // Fetch from Google Sheets
  const { data: brands, isLoading } = trpc.data.getBrands.useQuery();

  // Show loading state while fetching
  if (isLoading) {
    return <ActivityIndicator size="large" />;
  }

  // Filter brands (same logic as before)
  const alignedBrands = brands?.filter(b => b.alignmentScore > 0) || [];
  const unalignedBrands = brands?.filter(b => b.alignmentScore < 0) || [];

  return <BrandList brands={alignedBrands} />;
}
```

## üì± Part 4: Migration Checklist

### Step 1: Format Your Google Sheets Data ‚úÖ

In your Google Sheets "Brands" tab:
- [ ] Column H (alignmentScore) has numbers (-100 to +100)
- [ ] Column I (keyReasons) uses JSON array format: `["Reason 1","Reason 2"]`
- [ ] Column J (relatedValues) uses JSON array format: `["value-id-1","value-id-2"]`
- [ ] All required columns (A, B, H) are filled

### Step 2: Test Data Fetch

Run this to verify data is loading correctly:
```bash
npm run test-sheets
```

Should show brands with alignment scores > 0.

### Step 3: Update One Screen as Test

Pick ONE screen to migrate first (I recommend the Home screen):

**File: `app/(tabs)/home.tsx`**

Change this:
```typescript
import { MOCK_PRODUCTS } from '@/mocks/products';
const products = MOCK_PRODUCTS;
```

To this:
```typescript
import { trpc } from '@/lib/trpc';
const { data: brands = [], isLoading } = trpc.data.getBrands.useQuery();
```

### Step 4: Run Your App

```bash
npm start
```

Navigate to the Home tab and see if brands load from Google Sheets!

### Step 5: Migrate Remaining Screens

Once one screen works, update these files:
- [ ] `app/(tabs)/search.tsx`
- [ ] `app/(tabs)/local.tsx`
- [ ] `app/(tabs)/shop.tsx`
- [ ] `app/product/[id].tsx`
- [ ] `app/onboarding.tsx`

## üéØ Quick Start: Test with Minimal Data

**Want to test RIGHT NOW before cleaning all your data?**

Just add **ONE properly formatted row** to test:

1. In your Google Sheets, Row 2, add:
   - **A**: `test-brand`
   - **B**: `Test Brand`
   - **D**: `Test`
   - **H**: `75`
   - **I**: `["Great brand","Trustworthy"]`
   - **J**: `["privacy"]`

2. Run test:
   ```bash
   npm run test-sheets
   ```

3. Should show "Test Brand" with score 75!

## ‚ùì Questions?

**Q: Do I need ALL columns filled?**
A: Minimum required: **A (id)**, **B (name)**, **H (alignmentScore)**. Others are optional.

**Q: What if I don't have shareholder data?**
A: Leave Column M empty or use: `[]`

**Q: Can I test with just a few brands?**
A: YES! Start with 3-5 properly formatted brands and test.
