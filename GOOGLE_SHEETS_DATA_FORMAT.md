## üéØ Understanding Dynamic Alignment Scoring

### **Key Concept: No Static Scores**

**Alignment scores are NOT stored** - they're calculated in real-time for each user based on:
1. Which values/causes the user cares about
2. How the brand aligns with those specific values
3. The brand's position (1-10) on each value

### **Example: How Scoring Works**

**User A** cares about: Privacy, Climate Change
**User B** cares about: Gun Rights, Immigration

**Apple Inc.** has these alignments:
```json
[
  {"valueId": "privacy", "position": 1, "isSupport": true},
  {"valueId": "climate-change", "position": 2, "isSupport": true},
  {"valueId": "gun-rights", "position": 8, "isSupport": false}
]
```

**Result:**
- **User A** sees Apple with alignment score **~95** (strongly aligned with privacy & climate)
- **User B** sees Apple with alignment score **~30** (weakly opposed to gun rights)

## üîë Critical: Column N (valueAlignments)

This is the **MOST IMPORTANT** column - it determines how brands are scored for each user.

### **Format**

JSON array of objects with this structure:

```json
[
  {"valueId": "value-name", "position": 1-10, "isSupport": true/false}
]
```

### **Field Definitions**

| Field | Type | Range | Meaning |
|-------|------|-------|---------|
| `valueId` | string | Must match Causes sheet | Which value/cause this relates to |
| `position` | number | 1-10 | How important this value is to the brand |
| `isSupport` | boolean | true/false | Does brand support (true) or oppose (false) this value? |

### **Position Scale**

| Position | Meaning | Examples |
|----------|---------|----------|
| 1 | Core brand identity | Apple's privacy focus, Patagonia's environmentalism |
| 2-3 | Major priority | Secondary mission values |
| 4-6 | Moderate position | Stated values but not primary focus |
| 7-9 | Weak stance | Occasional mentions or minor actions |
| 10 | Minimal involvement | Rarely discussed or acted upon |

## üìù How to Populate valueAlignments

### **Step 1: Research the Brand**

For each brand, research:
- What values do they **actively promote**?
- What values do they **actively oppose**?
- What's their **ranking** of importance? (Look at: mission statements, annual reports, public statements, actions)

### **Step 2: List Top 5-10 Values**

Pick the 5-10 most relevant values. Don't try to include everything.

### **Step 3: Rank by Importance**

Assign position 1-10 based on how central this value is to the brand's identity/actions.

### **Step 4: Determine Support vs Opposition**

- `isSupport: true` = Brand actively supports this value
- `isSupport: false` = Brand actively opposes this value

## üí° Tips for Efficient Data Entry

### **Start Small**

Don't try to add all 764 brands at once. Start with:
1. Top 10 most popular brands
2. Test the scoring algorithm
3. Add more brands gradually

### **Focus on Key Values**

You don't need to list every possible value. Focus on:
- 5-10 most important values per brand
- Values that users actually care about
- Values where brand has clear stance

### **Use Templates**

Create templates for common brand types:

**Tech Company Template:**
```json
[
  {"valueId":"privacy","position":X,"isSupport":true/false},
  {"valueId":"workers-rights","position":X,"isSupport":true/false},
  {"valueId":"climate-change","position":X,"isSupport":true/false},
  {"valueId":"innovation","position":X,"isSupport":true}
]
```

**Energy Company Template:**
```json
[
  {"valueId":"climate-change","position":X,"isSupport":true/false},
  {"valueId":"environmental-protection","position":X,"isSupport":true/false},
  {"valueId":"renewable-energy","position":X,"isSupport":true/false}
]
```

### **Batch Similar Brands**

Group similar brands and use similar structures:
- All oil companies: Similar patterns around climate/environment
- All tech companies: Similar patterns around privacy/data
- All fast food: Similar patterns around health/workers

## üöÄ Testing Your Data

After adding data:

1. **Test fetch:**

## üìû Need Help?

Common issues:

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "Failed to parse JSON" | Use JSON validator, check quotes/commas |
| No scores showing | Check that valueAlignments has valid data |
| Wrong scores | Verify positions (1-10) and isSupport (true/false) |
