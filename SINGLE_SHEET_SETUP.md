# Value-Brand Matrix: Single Sheet Setup

## ‚úÖ The Smart Approach: One Sheet for Everything

Your existing matrix already combines:
- **Causes/Values data** (columns A-C)
- **Brand alignments** (columns D onwards)

This eliminates the need for separate Causes and Value-Brand-Matrix sheets!

## üìä Sheet Structure

**Sheet Name:** `Value-Brand-Matrix`

## üîß Backend Processing

The backend automatically:

1. **Fetches the sheet** from Google Sheets
2. **Extracts causes** from columns A-C
3. **Extracts alignments** from columns D-W
4. **Builds valueAlignments** for each brand

**Example transformation:**

**From your matrix (Privacy row):**
```
id: privacy
aligned1: Proton
aligned2: Signal
aligned3: DuckDuckGo
unaligned1: Alphabet
unaligned2: Meta
unaligned3: Amazon
```

**Becomes:**

**Proton brand:**
```json
{
  "valueAlignments": [
    {"valueId": "privacy", "position": 1, "isSupport": true}
  ]
}
```

**Alphabet brand:**
```json
{
  "valueAlignments": [
    {"valueId": "privacy", "position": 1, "isSupport": false}
  ]
}
```

## ‚úÖ Setup Steps

### Step 1: Upload Your Matrix

You already have the data! Just:

1. Open your Google Sheets spreadsheet
2. Create/rename a sheet to: **`Value-Brand-Matrix`**
3. Paste your existing data (the one you showed me)
4. Make sure header row is:
   ```
   id | name | category | aligned1 | aligned2 | ... | aligned10 | unaligned1 | ... | unaligned10
   ```

### Step 2: Update .env

Add/update in your `.env` file:

```bash
SHEET_NAME_VALUE_MATRIX=Value-Brand-Matrix
```

### Step 3: Test

```bash
npm run test-sheets
```

Should show:
- ‚úÖ Fetched X causes from Value-Brand-Matrix sheet
- ‚úÖ Fetched Y brands from Brands sheet
- ‚úÖ Built valueAlignments for Z brands from matrix

### Step 4: Validate

```bash
npm run validate-matrix
```

Checks:
- ‚úÖ Each value has exactly 10 aligned brands
- ‚úÖ Each value has exactly 10 unaligned brands
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Warnings for any incomplete values

## üìä Your Current Data

Looking at your matrix, you have:

**Values Count:** ~69 values (libertarian, conservative, liberal, socialism, etc.)
**Categories:**
- Ideologies: libertarian, conservative, liberal, socialism, feminism, etc.
- Social Issues: abortion, gun-rights, climate-change, lgbtq, privacy, etc.
- Religions: christians, muslims, judaism, buddhism
- Nations: china, russia, israel, france, italy, japan, various US states
- Organizations: nba, nfl, mlb, nhl, clinton-foundation, aclu, hollywood, wall-street, silicon-valley
- People: elon-musk, lebron-james, taylor-swift, joe-rogan, donald-trump, bernie-sanders, etc.

**Brand Coverage:** Each value appears to have 10 aligned + 10 unaligned brands ‚úÖ

## üéØ Data Quality Notes

From your matrix, I notice:

### ‚úÖ Good Structure
- Clear categories (ideology, social_issue, religion, nation, organization, person)
- Consistent naming (lowercase-with-hyphens for IDs)
- Full coverage (10+10 for each value)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Potential Issues to Check

1. **Duplicate Brands Across Columns**
   - Example: "libertarian" row has SpaceX, PayPal, etc. in BOTH aligned AND unaligned columns
   - Should a brand appear in both? (Usually no)

2. **Brand ID Format**
   - Some brands use full names: "Sturm, Ruger & Co."
   - Others use IDs: "apple", "meta"
   - **Important:** These need to match brand IDs in your Brands sheet exactly

3. **Validation Recommended**
   - Run `npm run validate-matrix` to catch:
     - Brand IDs that don't exist in Brands sheet
     - Duplicate brands in same row
     - Missing positions

---

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Upload this matrix** to Google Sheets as "Value-Brand-Matrix" sheet
2. **Ensure brand IDs match** your Brands sheet (lowercase, no spaces)
3. **Run validation** to catch any issues
4. **Test integration** with test-sheets script

## ‚ùì FAQ

**Q: Do I still need a separate Causes sheet?**
**A:** No! The Value-Brand-Matrix sheet serves both purposes now.

**Q: What if a brand appears in multiple values?**
**A:** That's expected! Apple can be aligned for privacy, unaligned for right-to-repair, etc.

**Q: Can I have fewer than 10 aligned/unaligned for a value?**
**A:** Technically yes, but users who select only that value won't see a full list. Validation will warn you.

**Q: What happens if a brand ID in the matrix doesn't exist in Brands sheet?**
**A:** The system will skip that brand and log a warning. Validation script will catch it.
